Carpooling is also known as car-sharing, ride-sharing or car-lifting. Carpooling is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person can travel in a same car. 
Due to the increase of population and rapid increase in urbanization, there is lot of problems in transportation especially in India. 
This tends to problems like increase in number of vehicles, traffic, fuel combustion, heavy cost on resources, parking problems and stress.
To overcome this hurdle, a quite different but realistic solution called “Carpooling” can be used.
We are working to make a Web based application that will enable to let people know if vehicles are available for carpool in their desired path and they can register for it.

This will enable people using this application to share their everyday expenditure on travelling, not worry about hiring a cab and making new connections.
People can have this application on their cell phone as well as on their tablets and can easily carpool with unacquainted people.
